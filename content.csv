This project explored how robotics and ML could help standardise medical percussion examinations.",Percussion_2.png,"Our Robotics Project Group introduced a <b>novel robotic percussion device</b> designed to imitate the human percussion technique through a two-degree-of-freedom linkage mechanism with adjustable joint stiffness.

This allowed for identifying the <b>optimal parameters to build a hardware prototype</b>. The device was evaluated on a silicone phantom tissue model, demonstrating a <b>force profile comparable to that of a human performer</b>, with reduced variability between successive percussion actions.",Percussion_3.mp4,I contributed to the <b>development and analysis of the initial robotic device</b>.

OnionBot was born from a desire for a robot that can soften onions while I work on other ingredients. The first OnionBot prototype combines machine vision and hobbyist electronics to showcase its ability to <b>cook a pasta and tomato sauce recipe autonomously</b>. I designed this project to build my skillset in Python algorithm and interface design and gain an understanding of ML at a prototype level.

This tech could also augment home cooking by <b>reducing errors and providing decision-making support</b> to busy parents and professionals. However, designing automation technology for home kitchens is a unique challenge, requiring versatile tools instead of specialised machines. While robot arms can replicate human-kitchen interaction, they are too large and costly for home use. Cameras can detect a wide range of cooking information, but there are currently no datasets for training cooking image classification algorithms. With OnionBot, I explored <b>combining industrial automation and machine vision</b> to create a simple robot that can fit on a kitchen countertop.",OnionBot_3.png,"OnionBot focuses on automating pan-cooking tasks. A Raspberry Pi-powered camera and thermal camera are mounted above the stove to monitor the cooking progress. The servo motor automatically adjusts the power setting of the induction stove. The project's objective is to provide <b>automation without adding excessive complexity</b>; instead of replacing the chef, OnionBot empowers them with multitasking capabilities. The human provides the 'actuation' enhanced by a touchscreen interface called ""sous-chef"" that offers instructions, reminders, and alerts. OnionBot takes care of the pan, enabling the chef to concentrate on culinary creativity. This <b>human-centred approach</b> is a novel concept in cooking robotics research.","OnionBot_4a.png
OnionBot_4b.png","Food image classification research has shown poor results in real-world scenarios due to the complex and variable nature of food images. To address these perception challenges in cooking, OnionBot introduces two innovations. Firstly, the <b>fixed camera view above the stove provides a consistent environment</b> for capturing images. Secondly, instead of pursuing a general classification approach, OnionBot adopts a milestone-based method where <b>only key cooking events, or milestones, are labelled</b> for a single recipe. This significantly simplifies the perception challenge by reducing the number of classes each classification model needs to identify (from 1000s to 10s). OnionBot includes a <b>labelling interface</b> for creating labelled cooking image datasets by clicking along with each milestone while cooking. Google AutoML is used for streamlined model training, enabling new recipe models to be trained with a few clicks.",OnionBot_5.png,"This prototype showcases the potential for automation in home cooking but requires large training datasets to succeed. I propose that a <b>fleet learning network</b> of OnionBot devices could crowd-source large labelled pan-cooking image databases. The fleet-generated dataset, including rich metadata, could drive new research into cooking with AI. <b>I open-sourced OnionBot</b> to encourage further research into home cooking automation. The project has generated a lot of interest, including from Texas-based Hill Yu who built an OnionBot prototype (pictured above) called <a href=""https://www.kitchenautomatique.com/"">Kitchen Automatique</a> and fundraised $40K to <b>commercialise the idea</b>.
