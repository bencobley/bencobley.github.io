","<i>Industrial</i> automation technology could also augment <i>home</i> cooking by <b>reducing errors and supporting decision-making</b>. However, designing automation tech for the home is a unique challenge, requiring versatile tools instead of specialised machines. While robot arms could replicate human-kitchen interactions, they are too big and costly for home use. Cameras could act as multi-purpose sensors, but no suitable cooking image datasets are available. With OnionBot, I combined <b> automation and machine vision techniques </b> into a simple countertop robot.

OnionBot_4b.jpeg","Food image classifiers show poor results in real-world scenarios due to the complexity and variability of food images. OnionBot introduces two innovations: Firstly, the <b>fixed camera view above the stove provides a consistent environment</b> for capturing images. Secondly, instead of pursuing a general classification approach, OnionBot adopts a milestone-based method where only<b>key cooking events, 'milestones', are labelled</b> for each recipe. This simplifies the perception challenge by significantly reducing the classification scope (from 1000s to 10s). I created a <b>labelling interface</b> to easily build labelled cooking image datasets by manually selecting each milestone while cooking. I used Google AutoML for streamlined model training, enabling new recipe models to be trained with just a few clicks.

Medical percussion involves tapping the chest, back, and abdomen to assess the condition of underlying tissues based on the resulting acoustic response. <b>Despite its frequent use in medical diagnosis, percussion dynamics are not fully understood.</b> Experienced practitioners modify the percussion force and impulse by adjusting the stiffness in their elbow and wrist joints, but the correlation between these adjustments and the acoustic response remains underexplored.
