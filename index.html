      Hey! Iâ€™m Ben. I am a technologist, engineer, & designer. I am currently
      working on game-changing tech for the recycling industry @
      <a>TrueCircle AI</a>. Before that, I studied at Imperial College London,
      where, I developed <a>cooking robots</a> and a
      <a>medical diagnosis device</a> [amongst other things!]. During the Design
      Engineering degree, I interned at Google X, Dyson, and Brompton. I got to
      work on some <a>great projects with great people</a>. In my free time, I
      love being outdoors and <a>building things with friends</a>. Interested in
      building new things / making a positive impact on earth?
      <a>Say hello!</a>.
