Our target audience is Plant Managers, who face the challenge of maintaining unreliable equipment and have limited time to make improvements for better profitability. They lacked the data to guide equipment upgrades or set the right price for their recycled material. Existing solutions in the market were not accurate enough and required a time-consuming and expensive setup process. TrueCircle AI offers a reliable solution to this problem.</span>

This has led to increased trust in material quality and a direct increase in revenue per tonne. To further drive efficiency, TrueCircle has also introduced Trade.

          <span class="text"><b>What is Percussion?</b> Medical percussion involves tapping the chest, back, and abdomen to assess the condition of underlying tissues based on the resulting acoustic response. <b>Despite its frequent use in medical diagnosis, percussion dynamics are not fully understood.</b> Experienced practitioners modify the percussion force and impulse by adjusting the stiffness in their elbow and wrist joints, but the correlation between these adjustments and the acoustic response remains underexplored. This project explored how robotics and ML could help standardise medical percussion examinations.</span>

          <span class="text">Our Robotics Project Group introduced a <b>novel robotic percussion device</b> designed to imitate the human percussion technique through a two-degree-of-freedom linkage mechanism with adjustable joint stiffness. The force profile of a medical student performing percussion was captured and used to inform the simulation of a mathematical model of the mechanism in MATLAB (above). This allowed for identifying the <b>optimal parameters to build a hardware prototype</b>. The device was evaluated on a silicone phantom tissue model, demonstrating a <b>force profile comparable to that of a human performer</b>, with reduced variability between successive percussion actions.</span>

          <span class="text"><b>My colleagues continued researching the topic after our graduation</b>. In their first experiment, the device used spectro-temporal analysis with 1-D Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to identify hard nodules resembling lipomas in silicone phantom tissue. In their second experiment, Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) and Neural Network (NN) predictive models were used to classify composite phantom tissue of varying density and thickness. The proposed device and methods achieved up to 97.5% accuracy in the classification of phantoms, indicating the potential for robotic solutions to <b>standardise and improve the accuracy of percussion</b> diagnostic procedures.

          <span class="text">OnionBot is a robotic kitchen assistant designed to <b>automate routine pan-cooking tasks, freeing you up to focus on more creative aspects of cooking</b>. OnionBot was born from a desire for a robot that can soften onions while I work on other ingredients. The first OnionBot prototype combines machine vision and hobbyist electronics to showcase its ability to <b>cook a pasta and tomato sauce recipe autonomously</b>. I designed this project to build my skillset in Python algorithm and interface design and gain an understanding of ML at a prototype level.

          <span class="text">Automation technology improves the work environment in the food industry reducing the physical and cognitive demands on workers. This tech could also augment home cooking by <b>reducing errors and providing decision-making support</b> to busy parents and professionals. However, designing automation technology for home kitchens is a unique challenge, requiring versatile tools instead of specialised machines. While robot arms can replicate human-kitchen interaction, they are too large and costly for home use. Cameras can detect a wide range of cooking information, but there are currently no datasets for training cooking image classification algorithms. With OnionBot, I explored <b>combining industrial automation and machine vision</b> to create a simple robot that can fit on a kitchen countertop.</span>

          <span class="text">OnionBot focuses on automating pan-cooking tasks. A Raspberry Pi-powered camera and thermal camera are mounted above the stove to monitor the cooking progress. The servo motor automatically adjusts the power setting of the induction stove. The project's objective is to provide <b>automation without adding excessive complexity</b>; instead of replacing the chef, OnionBot empowers them with multitasking capabilities. The human provides the 'actuation' enhanced by a touchscreen interface called "sous-chef" that offers instructions, reminders, and alerts. OnionBot takes care of the pan, enabling the chef to concentrate on culinary creativity. This <b>human-centred approach</b> is a novel concept in cooking robotics research.</span>

          <span class="text">Food image classification research has shown poor results in real-world scenarios due to the complex and variable nature of food images. To address these perception challenges in cooking, OnionBot introduces two innovations. Firstly, the <b>fixed camera view above the stove provides a consistent environment</b> for capturing images. Secondly, instead of pursuing a general classification approach, OnionBot adopts a milestone-based method where <b>only key cooking events, or milestones, are labelled</b> for a single recipe. This significantly simplifies the perception challenge by reducing the number of classes each classification model needs to identify (from 1000s to 10s). OnionBot includes a <b>labelling interface</b> for creating labelled cooking image datasets by clicking along with each milestone while cooking. Google AutoML is used for streamlined model training, enabling new recipe models to be trained with a few clicks.</span>

          <span class="text">This prototype showcases the potential for automation in home cooking but requires large training datasets to succeed. I propose that a <b>fleet learning network</b> of OnionBot devices could crowd-source large labelled pan-cooking image databases. The fleet-generated dataset, including rich metadata, could drive new research into cooking with AI. <b>I open-sourced OnionBot</b> to encourage further research into home cooking automation. The project has generated a lot of interest, including from Texas-based Hill Yu who built an OnionBot prototype (pictured above) called <a href="https://www.kitchenautomatique.com/">Kitchen Automatique</a> and fundraised $40K to <b>commercialise the idea</b>.

          <span class="text">Campervan conversion personal project with friends during our year off. We took an unusual approach to typical van conversions, opting for an aluminium extrusion frame wrapped in lightweight plywood. Sleeping four comfortably meant thinking outside the box. We had three design goals:
<ul>
  <li>Four berths and four seats, comfortably.</li>
  <li>Switching from day to night mode should take seconds, not minutes.</li>
  <li>We won't get it 100% right first time, so everything should be removable</li>
</ul></span>

          <span class="text">For power, I built a fully off-grid solar system, so that the van never needs to be plugged in. I learnt how to spec solar panels, controllers etc. through online tutorials and assembled the system myself (see timelapse above). The specs:

<ul>
  <li>1200W Inverter for 240V mains power</li>
  <li>100Ah 12V Lithium battery</li>
  <li>440W Domestic Solar Panel</li>
  <li>30A charger from vehicle alternator</li>
  <li>Bluetooth connectivity to phone application</li>
  <li>LED lights, 12V phone chargers, fridge, water pump etc.</li>
</ul>

Building a campervan was fulfilling, but way more work than I ever imagined. Proceed with caution!</span>
