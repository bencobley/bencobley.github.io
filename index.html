            TrueCircle AI is a climate-tech startup developing ground-breaking
            computer vision hardware that enables recycling facilities to
            recover valuable material more effectively and sell material more
            efficiently. We retrofit industrial cameras above conveyor belts to
            capture continuous footage of material streams. Our state-of-the-art
            model calculates composition by weight in real-time, to a 95%+
            accuracy. We’ve built industry-leading dashboards that empower
            facilites to run more efficiently, preventing recyclable material
            from going to landfill.
